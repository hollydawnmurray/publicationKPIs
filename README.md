# publicationKPIs
Analyses of publication impact from multiple sources - as part of L4DA summative portfolio.

The Jupyter Notebook creates a summarised speadsheet of monthly KPIs collected from multiple sources across Health Data Research UK.
The output is an exel file with summary statistics that can be used by colleagues to view current metrics, and compare those over time. Outputs also include basic visualisations.
